## What is PyInstaller GUI?
Original pyinstaller has too much command, and if I have different files or import module on different path, the command will become very loooooooooong~, so I think maybe I can use GUI to solve my problem.

This application is coded by **Python** and web frameworks **Tornado**, so it will use Web to show control interface.

## Usage
1. If you use exe file, just double click PyInstallerGUI.exe
2. If you download source code to use, just open and run **PyInstallerGUI.py**
3. if your browser doesn't open automatically, you can open it by yourself and go to **http://localhost:8888**
4. You can see the GUI below now

<br>6. The most fast usage has only 3 steps, see below
